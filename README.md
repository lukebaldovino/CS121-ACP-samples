## üëãüèª Greetings!
Welcome to the **CS 121: Advanced Computer Programming** course!üêçüíôüíõ

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to Python programming, covering fundamental concepts such as basic syntax, operators, and data structures, and advancing to more complex topics including object-oriented programming, exception handling, and algorithms. 

After this course, students will gain practical experience with GUI development using Tkinter and database management with MySQL, equipping them the skills to build robust and interactive applications. 

Through hands-on projects and exercises, learners will develop a solid foundation in both programming principles and real-world application development.

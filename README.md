## üëãüèª Greetings!
Welcome to the **CS 121: Advanced Computer Programming** course!üêçüíôüíõ

This Python course provides a solid foundation in the language, covering setup, syntax, and core operations, then advancing to topics like data structures, control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming. 

Students will also learn file handling, modular design, and error management, developing strong problem-solving skills. 

By the end, they will be equipped to handle real-world challenges and explore Python further.
